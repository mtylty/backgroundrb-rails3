Description:
    Creates a migration to add the job queue table used by BackgrounDRb.
    At present, the migration name is FIXED!
    This is mainly because the ActiveRecord model's name for storing the 
    queues is fixed.

Example:
    rails generate backgroundrb:bdrb_migration

    Assuming this is run at 09:00:15h on 12 September, 2008, this will create the
    CreateBackgroundrbQueue migration in:

        db/migrate/20080912090015_backgroundrb_create_backgroundrb_queue_table.rb
